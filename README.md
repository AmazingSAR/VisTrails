DAT branch

This branch contains the original development history of the DAT.

It has been rebased May 2015 and is being integrated in VisTrails.

A lot has happened here, the original DAT code for matplotlib became VisTrails' "tabledata" package, pylab has been replaced by matplotlib... Therefore the actual history of DAT's development will no longer be visible in the DAT git log. But this branch has been preserved. Its commits are also referenced by early revisions of the DAT repository.
