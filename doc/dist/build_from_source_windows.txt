== Windows Build ==

Download and install python from www.python.org. Get both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Install the 64-bit version in C:\Python27_64 and the 32-bit version in C:\Python27

Download and install msysgit (the windows git user is winbuild and there's no passphrase when generating the ssh keys.

Download and install PyQt4 binary installers (includes sip, Qt and QScintilla)

Download and install active tcl/tk 8.5 both 32-bit and 64-bit versions (make sure to install them in different directories C:\Tcl and C:\Tcl_64

download boost library from www.boost.org and uncompress it to a local folder,
I had problems building vtk with recent versions of boost, the version I know it works for sure is 1.46.1.
So extract the zip file to a folder, for example ~/src/boost_1_46_1 vtk will use the same boost for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions

Download and install cmake
Get vtk source
uncompress it to (e.g, ~\src\vtk\vtk-5.10.1\
and rename the VTK folder to src
create build and build64 folders in ~\src\vtk\vtk-5.10.1

vtk 32-bit:
  run cmake-gui pointing the src folder to src and build folder to build and press configure
  select Visual Studio 9 2008 
  mark the following variables:
   BUILD_SHARED_LIBS 
   VTK_WRAP_PYTHON
 on the top check Advanced
   now mark
    VTK_USE_BOOST
    VTK_USE_TEXT_ANALYSIS  
 and press configure
  Set 
     Boost_INCLUDE_DIR  to ~/src/boost_1_46_1 (or where you uncompressed boost)
   make sure it is using the correct versions of tcl and python (they should point to 32-bit installed versions)
 press configure again and finally press generate
  now browse to the build directory and open VTK.sln in Visual Studio
  On the top bar select Release and then build solution (F7)   
If all goes well, you can install vtk python bindings:
open a command prompt in the build/Wrapping/Python folder and run the following command:
C:\Python27\python.exe setup.py BUILD_TYPE=Release install


vtk 64-bit:

  run cmake-gui again pointing the src folder to src and build folder to build64 and press configure
  select Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64
  mark the following variables:   
     BUILD_SHARED_LIBS    
     VTK_WRAP_PYTHON 
on the top check Advanced   
   now mark    
     VTK_USE_BOOST    
     VTK_USE_TEXT_ANALYSIS   
and press configure   

 Set 
     Boost_INCLUDE_DIR  to ~/src/boost_1_46_1 (or where you uncompressed boost)
     Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS to ~/src/boost_1_46_1/libs 

    make sure it is using the correct versions of tcl and python (they should point to 64-bit installed versions) press configure again and finally press generate  now browse to the build64 directory and open VTK.sln in Visual Studio  On the top bar select Release and then build solution (F7)  
If all goes well, switch to the 64 bit Path and you can install vtk python bindings:
open a command prompt in the build64/Wrapping/Python folder and run the following command:
C:\Python27_64\python.exe setup.py BUILD_TYPE=Release install 

Now let's build each configuration at time, starting with the 32-bit version:

== 32-bit version ==

Download fftw (http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html) from ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw-3.3.3-dll32.zip and extract the zip file to the folder ~/src/fftw-3.3.3-dll32
