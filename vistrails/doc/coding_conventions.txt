Importing modules:

    Please import the modules using the fully qualified names,
    even if they are in the right directories. For example, if you
    have a file inside vistrails/core that imports a module inside 
    vistrails/core/data_structures, do NOT use this

    import data_structures.graph     # WRONG, don't do it!

    instead, say

    import core.data_structures.graph   # RIGHT

    This allows us to run the modules as standalone classes, which is
    good for testing purposes.
