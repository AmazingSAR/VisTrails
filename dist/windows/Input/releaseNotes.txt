Changes:
 - Added "Set Module Label" feature (through the configuration pop-up
    menu of the GUI)
 - Improved error messages
 - Added vistrails files for many of the vtk examples
 - Added support for packages to create menus in the builder window
   (see spreadsheet package for an example)
 - Modules and input ports can be automatically registered by 
   setting per-module _input_ports and _output_ports fields and 
   per-package _modules field (see teem package at www.vistrails.org)
 - Removed graphviz dependency
 - Ability to export workflow and history views to PDF
 - In WevServices Package: Improved support to web services using
   complex types 
 - Added a BooleanWidget, so Booleans are now given by a checkbox 
 - In VTK Package: 
   + Added Transfer Function Widget
   + Added dataset inspectors, special vtk modules that allow users
     to easily query bounds and scalar range of an object.
   + Added support for vtkTIFFReader to allow volumetric (slice-based)
     reads.
 - Added support for grouping modules in pipelines
 - Incorporated many optimizations in the code
 - Added namespace support to packages

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed analogies
 - Version tree was not refreshed when analogy was applied on the spreadsheet
 - Fixed double drawing of module names and version node names on the mac
 - Added support for running Visual Diff for pipelines with 
   PythonSources and other modules with a local registry that 
   have different input and output ports
 - Changed the behavior of selecting new cell locations on the
   spreadsheet when it is full (cycling vs. using always the first
   cell)
 - Fixed bug where options passed through the command line were
   written to the startup.xml file


From Release v1.0.1 build 1063 
Changes:
 - In VTK Package: Exporters now take a VTKCell as input when exporting 
   the scene
 
Bug fixes:
 - Caching mechanism: VTK modules didn't take the connections into account 
   when deciding whether to cache or not. This is related with the error
   message "function expects 1 argument, got 0 instead".
 - Fixed Parameter Exploration bugs where parameter widgets did not update 
   correctly when changes are made to the pipeline.
