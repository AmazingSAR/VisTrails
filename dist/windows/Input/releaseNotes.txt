Changes from previous releases

From release 502:

Changes:
 - Module's color and shape can be customized
   See http://vistrails.sci.utah.edu/index.php/UsersGuideVisTrailsPackages
   for instructions on how to use it
 - New parameter exploration interface (we will temporarily keep
   the old one)
 - Refactoring the importing modules mechanism to use 'bundles', 
   which are system-level packages that should correspond to RPMs,
   APT.debs, etc. Now VisTrails is able to use the system-level 
   package management to install required modules (working only on
   Ubuntu, right now)
 - Fixed saving spreadsheet state
 - Fixed issues when trying to add a bookmark from an unsaved
   vistrail
 - Fixed menus and buttons behaviors
 - Fixed bug on trying to use ImageMagick package on Windows
 - Improvements on the abstraction mechanism


From release 444:

Changes:
 - Added pylab package that wraps Matplotlib
 - Added vistrails examples illustrating the use of pylab, 
   abstraction (subpipelines), offscreen rendering, and CORIE

 - Packages now check for dependencies when loaded
 - Moved QVTKWidget, VTKCell from spreadsheet package to vtk package

   core.inspector.py)   
 - Aliased parameters can now be set when running vistrails in non-
   interactive mode with the "-a" option. See wiki FAQ for an example.
