This directory contains the vistrails package for latex.

It allows you to include the image generated by vistrails 
by calling vistrails directly.

To use it, copy vistrails.sty and includevistrail.py to the same 
place where your .tex files are.

add the following lines to the beginning of the latex file:

\usepackage{vistrails}

\renewcommand{\vistrailspath}{/path/to/vistrails.py}

Then include the following command where you would like to include 
the vistrails images:

\vistrails[host=vistrails.sci.utah.edu,
db=vistrails,
version=<version_number>,
vtid=<vistrails_id>,
buildalways]{width=0.45\linewidth}

The buildalways option is optional and if provided it will always call 
vistrails, even if it was already called once for the same combination
of host, db, version and vt_id.

The options inside { }  are the options you would give to 
\includegraphics{} command

The option -shell-escape needs to be activated on the latex command line:

pdflatex -shell-escape example.tex

Vistrails will create in the current directory a directory called 
vistrails_images/host_db_vtid_version with the png files generated by 
the spreadsheet.

See example.tex for a complete example of usage.
