%% This file illustrates how to embed images of vistrails published on crowdLabs.
%% Please refer to 
%% http://www.crowdlabs.org/site_media/static/user_docs/vistrails_usage.html 
%% for instructions on how to publish workflows to crowdLabs.

%% The crowdlabs extension requires python. If your python is not in the path,
%% uncomment the line below and edit with the path to your python executable
%\renewcommand{\vistrailspythonpath}{C:/Python27/python.exe}

%% You need to enable the crowdlabs package. Make sure crowdlabs.sty is located
%% in the same directory as the .tex file in which you want to embed the images.
